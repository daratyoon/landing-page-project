    <h2>Welcome to</h2>
    <h1>AUSTIN, Texas</h1>
    <h3>The Music Capital</h3>

    <p>
      Besides being the state capital of Texas, Austin is also the hub for
      creative culture in the state. It's home to the University of Texas at
      Austin, and it's as well-known for live music as it is for Tex-Mex
      cuisine. South by Southwest (also known as SXSW) and Austin City Limits
      (ACL) music festivals take over the city each spring and fall.
